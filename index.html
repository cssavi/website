                    My best friend Moh got me into going for early morning runs to box at Richard Lord's (the Austin legend's) boxing gym this past semester.
                    For a guy who was scared of getting hit in the face I've definitely lost more brain cells than I can count. Luckily,
                    having volatile memory isn't such a bad thing and it actually frees up space for me to ingest new material. As every college kid does, 
                    I tried to branch out, and I ended up deep diving into Blockchain technology and Quantitative trading over my past two years at UT Austin. 
                    Between the two very different industries I think I have found that what both have in common, and what I enjoy doing, software engineering.
                    Anywho, front-end was never really my forte, but there are some really cool gimmicks I found that hopefully brighten up the page a bit!
